**Rosetta Stone Subscriber Analysis**

**Executive Summary:**

This report presents the modeling, analysis, and insights derived from examining the data frame concerning Rosetta Stone subscribers. Each objective presented distinct challenges, necessitating specialized data manipulation and model application to fulfill.

To identify customer segments, a Tableau dashboard was employed for an in-depth analysis of the data frame. Segmentation was conducted using a percentile-based method, resulting in the categorization of four distinct segments: undesired subscriber, casual subscriber, cash flow subscriber, and desired subscriber.

The identification of the most valuable subscribers revealed that those with extended subscription durations and substantial purchase amounts were of the highest value. These subscribers typically chose auto-renewal, exhibited high ID counts, were often lifetime subscribers, and demonstrated a high email open rate. This conclusion was supported by data from percentile-based segmentation and insights from random forest regression analysis.

In accentuating subscribers with upselling potential, it became evident that a K-Means clustering algorithm would enable the ability to identify these desired customer segments. After tuning the hyperparameters and building the finalized model, four clusters emerged. The two customer bases identified as being highly attractive from the model ('Loyal Subscribers' & 'Life-Time Subscribers') had comparatively high amount of email engagement, high propensity for auto renew to be on, and fairly high subscription duration and purchase amount. Should Rosetta Stone gather additional customer information, they should aim to market additional products and services to these respective customer groups.

To identify indications of subscriber churn and enable the ability to predict this churn, two classification models were implemented. The first, a logistic regression trained to predict 'Auto Renew', this model quantified that the biggest indications of churn subscription duration and number of emails sent. A random forest classification model was built to supplement the findings from the logistic regression. While both model's indicated similar feature importance, the more complex random forest model enables Rosetta Stone executives to run new customers through this model and predict if they will churn at the end of their billing cycle with 84% accuracy.

When identifying additional business opportunities for Rosetta Stone, the focus was on analyzing variables such as ID Count, lead platforms, user types, and push notifications. Leveraging subscriber data for monetization and strategic use was highlighted, indicating that detailed analysis can provide valuable insights for various entities. Implementing gamification elements like quests and challenges, linked with push notifications, aimed to boost user engagement and satisfaction. The strategies also included tailoring offerings to the larger consumer base, suggesting features such as in-app transactions and premium badges to incentivize spending, thus retaining and monetizing existing customers. These approaches are designed to contribute to Rosetta Stone's overall growth and profitability, enriching the user experience and encouraging ongoing engagement and financial investment.
